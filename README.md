The Hangman game is built to guess the country name based on the national animal image of that country shown in the screen.

Press any key to start the game.

You can make upto 5 guesses to win each round.

Once you guess the country correctly the count of wins increases and a new animal would be displayed to guess the country name.

Even if you loose the round you still get a new animal displayed to guess the country name. But the number of wins will not be incremented.

Press reset button to start a new game with Number of Wins = 0 count.
